# Keyboard Navigation Script Explanation

This JavaScript code is designed to manage keyboard interactions within a webpage, specifically using the up (`↑`) and down (`↓`) arrow keys to navigate between elements and modify their classes.

## Initial Setup

```javascript
var active = document.querySelector(".active");
```
Selects the first element in the document with the class `active` and assigns it to the variable `active`.

## Event Listener

```javascript
document.addEventListener("keydown", handler);
```
Sets up an event listener on the entire document for the `keydown` event. Whenever a key is pressed, the function `handler` will be called.

## The `handler` Function

```javascript
function handler(key) {
  // Code inside this function
}
```
Executed every time a key is pressed. It receives an event object (`key`) that contains information about the key press.

## Navigation Logic

Inside the `handler` function:

1. **Remove Active Class**:
   ```javascript
   active.classList.remove("active");
   ```
   Removes the `active` class from the currently active element.

2. **Down Arrow Key (Key Code 40)**:
   ```javascript
   if (key.which == 40) {
     active = active.nextElementSibling || active;
   }
   ```
   Sets `active` to the next sibling element if the down arrow is pressed. Keeps `active` as it is if there's no next sibling.

3. **Up Arrow Key (Key Code 38)**:
   ```javascript
   else if (key.which == 38) {
     active = active.previousElementSibling || active;
   }
   ```
   Sets `active` to the previous sibling element if the up arrow is pressed. Keeps `active` as it is if there's no previous sibling.

4. **Add Active Class**:
   ```javascript
   active.classList.add("active");
   ```
   Adds the `active` class back to the new `active` element.

## Additional Class Manipulation

1. **Next Element Class Manipulation**:
   ```javascript
   next = active.nextElementSibling || active;
   next.classList.remove("green-btn");
   next.classList.add("gray-btn");
   ```
   Handles the element right after the active one. Removes `green-btn` class and adds `gray-btn` class.

2. **Previous Element Class Manipulation**:
   ```javascript
   prev = active.previousElementSibling || active;
   prev.classList.remove("gray-btn");
   prev.classList.add("green-btn");
   ```
   Addresses the element right before the active one. Removes `gray-btn` class and adds `green-btn` class.

## Summary

This script enables keyboard navigation through elements with the up and down arrow keys, changing their classes to reflect the active element and its immediate neighbors. It's a common approach in interactive web applications to improve user navigation and visual feedback.
